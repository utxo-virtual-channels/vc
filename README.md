# UTXO-based virtual channels

A small tool to create and evaluate the required transactions for UTXO-based virtual channels in Bitcoin 
for both a validity and non-validity construction.

## Usage:

- Install Python >= 3.7.3
- Install dependencies (check requirements.txt)
- execute main.py
- inspect the output to see raw transactions and size
- optional: enter different private keys and unspent TX outputs, publish resulting transactions on testnet
